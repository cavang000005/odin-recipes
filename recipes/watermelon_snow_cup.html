        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This easy, healthy version can be made at home and doesn’t even require a sno-cone machine.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large ripe watermelon (5 to 6 pounds)</li>
            <li>2 limes, cut into wedges</li>
            <li>Tajin seasoning, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the watermelon in half lengthwise, then cut each half widthwise to yield 4 equal pieces. Now cut each quarter into 1-inch-thick slices, being sure to include the rind.</li>
            <li>Select a baking sheet that can fit into your freezer, then cut a piece of plastic wrap twice as long as the sheet. Place half on the sheet and let the other half hang over the side. Place the cut watermelon wedges on the plastic wrap in a single layer. Make sure they don’t touch, or they’ll freeze together.</li>
            <li>When the tray is full, fold the other half of plastic wrap over the watermelon pieces to cover them. Place tray in the freezer until watermelon is completely frozen, at least 4 hours, but overnight is best.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to make your snow cups, remove as much watermelon as you need from the freezer, leaving the rest in the freezer for later use. Grate frozen watermelon into a cold metal bowl using the fine side of a metal box grater to achieve a snow-like consistency.</li>
            <li>Divide into smaller cold glass bowls for serving. For more flavor, squeeze the juice from a lime wedge over the snow cup or try sprinkling it with Tajín.</li>
        </ol>
